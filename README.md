# PomodoroTimer

I've seen a few timer projects and wanted to recreate a Pomodoro timer with 
an actual tomato with CSS! It was a bit challenging but also fun as I got
to unleash some of my creativity ✨

The timer runs on 'start' and to pause click 'stop'.
You can continue from the time you've paused with 'start' again.

 🗝Key Concepts: 
- CSS positioning
- CSS border-radius
- JS setInterval and clearInterval
- DOM
